			<p>Sustainable Future, LLC discontinued solar installations in late 2013 and is no longer in business. To find a list of current solar installers, see the NABCEP web site.</p>

			<p>ETPRI and a branch location of the Fish food pantry currently operate out of the former Sustainable Future, LLC site.</p>

			<p>I want to thank all the people and organizations that worked with Sustainable Future, LLC to help move the area toward a Sustainable Future.</p>

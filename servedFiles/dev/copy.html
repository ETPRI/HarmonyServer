<b>Copy from the logged-in server to a database on another server</b><br>
Notes: No need to enter "http" - that is added by the program.<br>
If entering an IP address, DO include the port number (unless it's a default port).<br>
<br>
Step 1: Log into the server you want to copy from (if you're seeing this, you should have done this step already)<br>
Step 2: Start an empty Neo4j database and NodeJS server on the destination computer<br>
Step 3: Enter the IP address, including port number, of the destination computer in the text box below these instructions and click the Start button<br>

<b>Copy to the logged-in server from a database on another server</b><br>
Notes: No need to enter "http" - that is added by the program.<br>
If entering an IP address, DO include the port number (unless it's a default port).<br>
You may only copy to the logged-in server if you are logged in LOCALLY - that is, if you're logged into 127.0.0.1 or localhost.

Step 1: Log into the server you want to copy to locally (if you're seeing this, you should have done this step already)<br>
Step 2: Start a Neo4j database and NodeJS server on your computer. The DB does not have to be empty, but be aware that whatever data is in it will be wiped out.<br>
Step 3: Enter the IP address, including port number, of the source computer in the text box below these instructions and click the Start button<br>
<br>
Source URL: <input type="text" id="copySource"><br>
<input type="button" id="startCopyFrom" value="start" onclick="copy.copyFromPromise()"><br><hr>
